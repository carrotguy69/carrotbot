# carrotbot
### (soon to be) a multi-purpose bot made with python and epicness.

**carrotbot** is a fun little python project started by [The Carrot Master](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCarrotMaster) for his discord server. The bot is the result of loads of discord bot tutorials on YouTube and code copied from Stack Overflow. Features are minimal at the moment due to real life things to worry about.  

The bot is made for a specific discord server, [The Carrot Cult](https://discord.gg/KCq8X3YdaM), so if you're confused on what the hell this thing does, join the discord to get some more context.
